# React Native Component Definition Error: Circular Dependency or Premature Rendering

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky error in React Native: issues caused by circular dependencies or attempting to render a component before it's fully defined.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` offers a solution.

## Problem
The core issue is that components `ComponentA` and `ComponentB` are mutually dependent, leading to a circular dependency.  This prevents React Native from correctly rendering either component.

## Solution
The solution involves refactoring to break the circular dependency.  This often involves creating a higher-order component or restructuring the data flow to eliminate the mutual dependence.
