To fix the circular dependency, refactor the components to avoid mutual imports.  One approach is to move the shared logic into a separate component or utility function. Here's a possible solution:

```javascript
// SharedComponent.js
const SharedComponent = () => {
  //Shared logic or data
  return (
    <View>
      {/*Shared UI elements*/}
    </View>
  );
};

// ComponentA.js
import SharedComponent from './SharedComponent';

const ComponentA = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <SharedComponent />
    </View>
  );
};

// ComponentB.js
import SharedComponent from './SharedComponent';

const ComponentB = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <SharedComponent />
    </View>
  );
};
```

Alternatively, consider restructuring your application's architecture if the shared logic is extensive, perhaps by using a state management solution like Redux or Context API.
