This error occurs when you try to use a component before it's fully defined. This often happens when there's a circular dependency between components, or when a component tries to render another component that hasn't been imported or defined yet.  For example:

```javascript
// Component A
import ComponentB from './ComponentB';

const ComponentA = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <ComponentB />
    </View>
  );
};

// Component B
import ComponentA from './ComponentA';

const ComponentB = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <ComponentA />
    </View>
  );
};
```

In this case, `ComponentA` imports `ComponentB` and vice-versa, creating a circular dependency. React Native will throw an error because neither component is fully defined before the other tries to render it.
